      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I’m a Computer Science student at DTU who loves building and experimenting with new ideas on the web. I started coding during my school days and since then, I’ve tried out small projects in HTML, Python, and C++.</p>

      <h3>Why I Built This Site</h3>
      <p>This website is part of a summer school assignment, but I plan to keep improving it as I learn more. It's fun to see something I've built live!</p>
