What each HTML element does:
- <h1> to <h6>: Headings helps to organize the page structure.
- <nav>: Helps in Grouped navigation on links.
- <ul>/<ol>: Unordered and ordered lists used for skills and education.
- <img>: Image of the project with alt text for better accessibility.
- <table>: Used for Displaying projects in tabular form.
- <form>: Accepts contact details from user.
- <input>, <textarea>, <fieldset>: Different input types for user data.
- <footer>: Closing section with copyright.

Why I chose specific input types:
- 'email' helps validate email format.
- 'tel' with pattern ensures only digits are entered.
- 'date' is user-friendly for selecting a day.
- 'range' adds interactivity and visual feedback.

Navigation:
I used a basic <nav> block with links to each file so users can go between pages easily.

Favicon:
A .svg file is linked in each page using the <link rel="icon"> tag.
